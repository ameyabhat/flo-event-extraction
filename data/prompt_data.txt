Marie , I am working this noon time on your orders . I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted . Both are in stock . The purchase price will be a little more because of freight . Also , my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate . I am checking with him and will let you know . Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders ? I have filled out the application for Robert Allen , but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in . My goal is to have it done by Friday . It 's just been very busy here ! Sorry for the delay !

Ernesto , can you please provide the following information : 1 . Please confirm that the date that Accro commenced commercial operation was 7/6/2001 The Accroven Commercial Operations start date was July 09 , 2001 . . 2 . At the time Accro payouts were approved for payment relative to financial close , the projected NPV of cash flows related to Enron 's interest was $ 18.331 million . An updated NPV calculation , reviewed and signed off on by RAC is required , to determine what , if any , additional payments might be presented to the Compensation Committee for approval . Norm Spalding has supplied December financials to Compensation and can supply them to the appropriate RAC individual . By copy of this email to Rick Buy , I am asking who in RAC is available to review the financials . Have you spoken to anyone in RAC about this project ? The Development Team had , at the time ( 21/2 years ago ) , the requirement to go to RAC for project approval . The Asset Management Co. has a `` valuation '' team that is constantly reviewing Proformas for all the assets and my understanding is that they work closely with RAC guidelines . I think the process will entail : 1 . Sign off by RAC . 2 . Sign off by Jim Hughes and Stan Horton . 3 . Sign off by Compensation Committee . 4 . Sign off by Creditor Committee and possibly E & Y even though these are bonuses associated with non-debtor entity . Thanks for your help .

I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model . She will make these and circulate the model later today . I few items worth mentioning - 1 ) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004 . However , the 2002 number is some $ 30 million below the `` Dynegy transition '' capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule . Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003 ? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven . 2 ) Keep O & M flat to 2001 numbers ? 3 ) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the `` contract roll off '' scenarios ? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2 % growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005 . Rod , not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow . Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under , there may or may not be any better alternative . 4 ) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $ 175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more `` reasonable '' levels . I can reduce the amount to $ 112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable . 5 ) We will show a reduction in A/R of $ 1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan . Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful . We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week . This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation . Thanks , Kevin

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year , I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible . One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing ( and trying to support with historical data ) to get automatic cash-out on OBA 's in `` constrained '' areas on TW . Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points . This may be the time ( the market to California is not so hot ) to try to implement this . I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them . Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing . Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting ?
